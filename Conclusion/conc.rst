Relating back to the Beginning
====================================
If my solution is effective, I expect to see reduced time for malicious/benign command analysis so operators can begin the incident response process. 
An increased accuracy in command determination, decreasing false positives and negatives. 
There will be a noticeable distinction between tuned and default open-source tool usage so operators can enhance their tools. 
Finally, there will be an overall strengthening in cybersecurity posture when operators can quickly identify malicious intent and take swift, appropriate action.

Thesis Restatement
==================
This investigation has addressed the challenges defensive cyberspace operators face in promptly distinguishing the malicious intention of encoded commands within cyberspace. 
With this thorough examination, the study has evaluated the viability and efficacy of open-source processes tailored to speed the identification of malicious encoded commands. 
Additionally, this analysis has emphasized strengthening operatorsâ€™ confidence levels and enabling faster incident response actions.
