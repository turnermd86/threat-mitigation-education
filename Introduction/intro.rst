According to the 2023 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, analysts discover approximately 60% of incidents within days of initial activity. However, 20% of the time, it could take months or more before organizations realize that adversaries are on the network. What would you do if you found malicious activity on your network and discovered it had been there for a year? Two years?

Thesis
=========
In cybersecurity, the widespread use of encoded commands presents a challenge for defensive cyberspace operators, impeding their ability to promptly determine such commands’ malicious intent. This study seeks to assess the existence and effectiveness of an open-source process designed to expedite the identification of malicious encoded commands, increase operators’ confidence levels, and enable quicker incident response actions.

Purpose of This Paper
=====================
Establishing a laboratory environment to analyze malware samples using encoded commands presents a potential solution. By leveraging open-source tools such as PowerDecode and databases like MalwareBazaar, the study will seek to deobfuscate encoded commands, analyze network traffic logs, and craft YARA signatures to detect common patterns signifying malicious activity. Subsequently, the findings will allow the formation of a thorough security awareness training framework tailored to cyberspace operators. This training will equip them with the knowledge and skills to identify encoded commands and implement effective threat mitigation strategies.
